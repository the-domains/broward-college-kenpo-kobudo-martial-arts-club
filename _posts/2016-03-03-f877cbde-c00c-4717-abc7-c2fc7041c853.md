Broward College Kenpo Club was like no other organization you would have ever attended. We were committed to making your experience a safe, and exciting adventure. Words such as Sincerity, Courtesy, and Respect are beyond just customary reflections. This was our commitment to you. This meant discovering your human potential, and manifesting that spirit within ourselves, our members, and our activities.

The purpose of our organization was to promote the understanding of human potential in a safe environment while enhancing one's body, spirit, and life which are portrayed through daily life choices, academic achievements, social life, and honing values such as determination, emotional balance, and discipline. At this time we are an Inactive Broward College martial arts organization. Please feel free to use this site as reference and entertainment purposes only
