Broward College Kenpo Club was like no other organization you would have ever attended. We were committed to making your experience a safe, and exciting adventure. Words such as Sincerity, Courtesy, and Respect are beyond just customary reflections. This was our commitment to you. This meant discovering your human potential, and manifesting that spirit within ourselves, our members, and our activities.
